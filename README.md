## Plugin Installation
Install the [plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/mabl-integration) into your Jenkins `v2.222+` server from the *Available Plugins* tab by searching for "mabl".

### Features

-   Launch mabl tests as a project step
-   Fail your Jenkins build if the mabl tests fail
    -   Optionally continue on failure

### Requirements

-   Minimum Jenkins version: *2.222.4*
-   Minimum Java runtime version: *8*
-   mabl API key
    -   See [integration
        docs](https://help.mabl.com/v1.0/docs/integrating-mabl-with-your-cicd-workflow#section-the-mabl-deployment-events-api)
        for details  

### Create a Jenkins credential for the mabl API key

-   Add a new credential accessible to the Jenkins job using the Secret text
    credential kind. The scope of the credential must be Global. The credential
    may be placed in any of the credential domains.
-   Set the secret to to the mabl API key
-   Set the ID of the credential to a value of your choosing

![](img/config-api-key.png)
          

### Adding a mabl Project Step

Add a *Run mabl tests* step to your new or existing project.

![](img/run-mabl-tests.png)

*Select the API key from the drop-down list*. Then select environment, and
application from the drop-down. At least one of environment and application
must be supplied.  All matching plans and their tests will be run during this
step. The step will block until the tests are complete/failed, or one
hour has elapsed.

![](img/config-env.png)

The *Advanced...* button opens up additional options:

-   Filter by plan labels to run only plans tagged with the selected
    labels. (You can select multiple labels using shift/ctrl click.)
-   Specify the test branch of your mabl tests
-   Continue execution if your plan/tests fail
-   Continue execution if there is an unexpected error in the mabl API
-   Disable SSL verification

![](img/config-advanced.png)

### Adding a mabl Pipeline Step

In a pipeline step, select 'Configure'. In the pipeline script, insert a
pipeline step for mabl. This can be written by hand or created via the
'Pipeline Syntax' tool. The available parameters are:

-   applicationId: Selects the application to run deployments
    against (one of environmentId or applicationId is required)
-   continueOnMablError: Continue if there is an unexpected error in the
    mabl API
-   continueOnPlanFailure: Continue if your plan/tests fail
-   environmentId: Selects the environment to run deployments against
    (one of environmentId or applicationId is required)
-   restApiKeyId: The id of the API key secret of the desired deployment workspace. The id is the value that is assigned in the Jenkins configuration to the corresponding secret. It is not the secret itself.
    Required
-   labels: if specified, only plans with (any of the) labels will be triggered.
    If multiple labels are provided, separate them with commas.
-   mablBranch: if specified, then tests from the specified branch will be executed.
    You may also want to use a Jenkins
    [environment variable](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/environment/) to specify the branch.   

Note that if you do not want to specify either the application ID or the environment ID,
then use an *empty* value in the pipeline configuration instead of completely omitting the
corresponding configuration attributes.

The following sections shows how to use the integration plugin in either a declarative or in a scripted
pipeline.

#### Declarative Pipeline

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
mabl applicationId: 'APP-ID-a', continueOnMablError: true, continueOnPlanFailure: true, environmentId: 'ENV-ID-e', restApiKeyId: 'REST-API-KEY-ID'
```

#### Scripted Pipeline

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
node {
  stage('mabl') {
    step([$class: 'MablStepBuilder', restApiKeyId: 'REST-API-KEY-ID', environmentId: 'ENV-ID-e', applicationId: 'APP-ID-a'])
  }
}
```

Note that Jenkins pipelines may time out before your tests complete. In this case, adjust
or set the `timeout` option in your pipeline configuration. See the
[Available Options](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#options) section on the
Jenkins documentation site for more information.

###  Environment Variable Collection

The mabl plugin will optionally collect build and repository information
to send along with mabl deployments. This will give more information and
insights into testing environment state for test runs. We will not
collect sensitive information such as passwords or API keys.

To enable this feature:

-   Go to the 'Manage Jenkins' page from the 'Dashboard'
-   Go to the 'Configure System' page
-   Find the 'mabl' section and check the 'Send build environment
    variables to mabl' checkbox

![](https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/138453951/Jenkins%20Send%20build%20Variables%20Checkbox.png?version=1&modificationDate=1529420356000&api=v2)

Now you will see the environment and build information collected in the
output log of future runs that use a mabl plugin step.

**Example Variable Collections**

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
Send build environment variables is set. Collecting the following information:
  'GIT_BRANCH' => 'origin/main'
  'GIT_COMMIT' => 'a246e0c756791965bdb6fc9caa1a36775422fcec'
  'GIT_URL' => 'git@github.com:example/my_repository.git'
  'GIT_PREVIOUS_COMMIT' => 'a246e0c73a691935bdb6fc9caa1a36775422fce5'
  'JOB_NAME' => 'mabl integration'
  'BUILD_NUMBER' => '47'
  'RUN_DISPLAY_URL' => 'http://127.0.0.1:9090/job/mabl%20integration/47/display/redirect'
```

### Configuring a proxy

This plugin requires access to resources hosted on the mabl cloud. If your Jenkins instance cannot directly access
Internet resources, then you have to configure Jenkins to use a proxy.

1. Visit the *Manage Jenkins* and then to the *Manage Plugins* page
2. Click on the *Advanced* tab
3. Fill out the *Server*, *Port*, and - if authentication is needed - the *User name* and/or *Password* fields
   that reflect the proxy configuration in your environment

### Upgrading from previous versions

#### Upgrading from pre-0.0.29 versions

Note that the format of the labels configuration setting has changed. When editing an existing job with labels
configured, make sure that you update the value to be a comma-separated list of values.

#### Upgrading from pre-0.0.20 versions

Note that
* Jenkins versions 1.x are no longer supported
* Minimum required Java version is Java 8
* Jobs with mabl steps will have to be _manually_ updated
  1. Create a Secret text kind credential to store the mabl API key. The scope of the credential must be set to Global.
     The credential may be placed in any of the credential domains.
  1. Make sure that you set the ID of the credentials
  1. Update the mabl step in each affected job

## Local Development
### Jenkins Docker
Overview of how to launch a Jenkins Docker instance with Jenkins, then build the plugin and deploy it that instance.

*Note:* Please check [Jenkins Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins)
for any specific image version before pulling Jenkins image.

```bash
# Launch Jenkins container and automatically pull the image if not present
docker run -d -p 9090:8080 --name=jenkins jenkins/jenkins

# Find initialAdminPassword to unlock Jenkins on a browser at localhost:9090
docker exec -it jenkins bash -c "cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword"

# Setup your Jenkins instance

# Build and deploy plugin to Jenkins (make sure you're in the mabl-integration-plugin directory)
mvn clean package \
  && docker cp target/mabl-integration.hpi jenkins:/var/jenkins_home/plugins/ \
  && docker restart jenkins
```

### Compatibility with Jenkins Enterprise

To ensure compatibility with Jenkins Enterprise, make sure the credentials
and plain credentials dependencies are compatible in the minimum version
of the enterprise release. Check the plugin list in the
[CloudBees Jenkins Distribution](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/release-notes/latest/cloudbees-jenkins-distribution/)
Release Notes.

You can also test with Jenkins Enterprise using the images published
on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudbees/jenkins-enterprise).

### Local Machine
Overview of how to run/debug plugin with Intellij on local machine.

- Open the project in Intellij
- Look for Edit Configurations under Run
- Add Maven template
- Configure your working directory to point to your project path similarly as
the screenshot below:
![Screenshot](img/Intellij-config.png)
- Click OK and then run/debug the plugin
- Wait until you see

        INFO: Jenkins is fully up and running

- Log into this URL on your web browser

        localhost:9090/jenkins
Now you can test your plugin.

## Deployment

Before making a new plugin release, ensure code is in high quality, fully tested state. See [extra checks](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugin+Release+Tips).

1. Update your `~/.m2/settings.xml` according to the [Jenkins docs](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Hosting+Plugins#HostingPlugins-Releasingtojenkins-ci.org).
2. Setup and run a GitHub [ssh agent](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent).
3. Run `mvn release:prepare release:perform -B` from the HEAD of main
4. Run `mvn deploy` on success of above step.

Wait ~8 hours for plugin to become GA across all Jenkins instances under the "Available Plugins" listing.
